# Research Paper Recommendation System

## Objective
This project aims to build a research paper recommendation system. Given a paper title as input, the system provides the top 5 recommended research papers. Additionally, it predicts the subject area of the input paper using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Large Language Model (LLM) (Mini LM L6-V2).

## Deep Learning Techniques Used
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Large Language Model (LLM) (Mini LM L6-V2) - [Link](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

## Flowchart
[Insert flowchart here]

This flowchart illustrates the process flow of the research paper recommendation system, including data preprocessing, model training, and recommendation generation.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used for training and evaluation is available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](link_to_kaggle_dataset).
